# TO DO

1. Condense Occasion and Comment Fields
2. Setup the volume leveling settings - auto analyze before work


# Adding New Music

Download the music to the `Dropbox/New Music Folder`


## New Music Settings

This works by only updating a file if the files have a changed timestamp or size. So if you want to actually set the tags of a file you have to manually sync the files with the tags with the `ctrl + s` commnad.

If you...

 - Edited a song to cut out the crowd noise - just let Monkey Media rescan the file.
 - Just fixed the tags for a bunch of new files - select the files and save the changes with `ctrl+s`

 To avoid songs I fixed the tags for from getting bumped to the top of the library I deselected the `modify timestamp when updating tags` option. I may want to change that. I JUST SET IT TO BUMP THEM UP AGAIN

## Auto Organize Schema

Make sure these schema are set
Music Folder - `Artist\Album\Track#\Title`
TV Shows Folder - `Series\Season\Episode#-Title`

I may want to set MM to auto organize in scans or edits but I don't want it to delete the SendToMonkeyMedia Folder.

# Automatic level the volume

- Check the Automatically analyze the volume of unanalyzed

My hope is by changing this and increasing the typical decibels to 95 I'll get more volume on mobile.

This requires analyzing almost all of the tracks!
