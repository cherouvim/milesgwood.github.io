# Uploading lots of files to s3 bucket

[Tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5123208/upload-folder-with-subfolders-using-s3-and-the-aws-console)

```
pip3 install --upgrade --user awscli
export PATH=/Users/miles/Library/Python/3.7/bin:$PATH
aws configure
```

You need to have your AWS access key ID and your secret access key. [Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration) You get these from the [Security Credentials page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials).

I set the Region to `us-east-1` and the output to `json`.

Looks like I will need to rename my s3 bucket to demographics.virginia.edu if we want the dotmap to be hosted at the same domain. Right now it is just called dotmap. [CNAME Records need to match](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34316277/cname-to-s3-bucket-amazon)
