# phpStorm File Watcher Setup
You need to get it to update continuously
Program: /Users/miles/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.4.1/bin/scss
Arguments: --no-cache --update $FileName$:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.css
Output paths to refresh: $FileNameWithoutExtension$.css:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.css.map

Sass is easier but having all of these preset css values is horrible.

I found a great trick for editing multiple lines at once in phpStorm.
The alt key adds a new cursor so you can type in two places at once.
