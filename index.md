# Recent Work

This site's goal is to provide quality explanation of the work I've been doing. If I or anyone else reads one of these pages and doesn't understand what's going on without clicking a link, I have been lazy and failed to make this a useful resource. Links don't help to understand anything, they just point you to a encyclopedia and tell you to go find the real answer you were looking for. All resources, links, and instructions need to be explained so that they can be useful later.

Don't be a lazy pile of garbage Miles. Write something useful.
